# Project Planning
The full extent of your project planning is up to your dev team.

At least one session should be devoted to taking the ideas and concepts from the project kickoff meeting with your sponsor and turning them into actionable items for your team to build.

There are many project planning ideas in the MD notes of Unit 7. 

In addition to those resources, I have evolved my own personal project planning guide into something your team can use for the capstone as well as you can use for any personal project you may have.

To use this effectively:
1. Open the Google Document.
2. In the upper left navbar menu click the "File" dropdown.
3. Click the "Make a Copy" option.
4. Name the file according to your project.
(If using project with a team: )
5. In the upper right hand corner is a "Share" button.
6. Share the file with edit access to your dev teammates.
