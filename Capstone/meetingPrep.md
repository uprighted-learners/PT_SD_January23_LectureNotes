# Capstone Sponsor
The Capstone sponsor will act as your contracted client or stakeholder. They are individuals, entrepreneurs, developers, etc. who have software/website ideas, but have yet to hire a team to turn them into reality. 

You and your capstone dev team will be creating their version 1 or a proof of concept they can evolve upon.

They have been informed of the following:
- Sponsor will be assigned to a group/cohort.
- Sponsor will work with their team of students to develop their website within a month-long capstone experience.
- As a capstone sponsor, they will be able to meet weekly with their student team, scheduling meetings and via email.
- Sponsors will attend a project kickoff meeting for project planning with their student team.
- Sponsors should be accessible through email so their student team can ask questions asynchronously.
- Sponsors have the option to attend demo day.
- Sponsors expect a full-stack working MERN project that will act as a proof of concept or base version 1 of their site/idea.

# Meeting with Your Capstone Sponsor

## Your First Meeting: Project Kickoff
Project kickoff will be the longest block of time you have with your sponsor (1-3 hours). This is the meeting where the project planning takes place. It is **_very important_**.

> This is something **_your capstone team schedules_** via email with them.

Many teams have prepared slide decks to walkthrough with their sponsor or have found ways to keep the meeting organized and constructive. 

Your team may want to meet prior to meeting directly with your sponsor to think through and pinpoint what information you will need from them.

Here are two recorded sponsor meetings as an example:

## Weekly Meetings
Weekly meetings with your sponsor will be for: 
- Checking in on project progress/updates.
- Getting sponsor opinions/feedback.
- A great time to ask any questions you need their input on that was not asked or answered asynchronously via email. 

These meetings are usually short and sweet, your group should come prepared with the agenda and meeting focus items.

These meetings should only last up to an hour at most. Many sponsors may have different availability and prefer 15-30 minute meetings for updates and questions. 

Setting up these meeting times will need to be done by your group via email with the sponsor.

> It is also a great idea to have a member of the team taking notes during these meetings as well.
