    Variables:

    - A declaration that stores data/data values

    Variables are declared with JS keywords:
    - var , old and not often used(prone to mistake) 
    - let , can reassign the variables value
    - const , cannot reassign a value to a const declared variable

    Undeclared/no keyword: works but don't do it.
