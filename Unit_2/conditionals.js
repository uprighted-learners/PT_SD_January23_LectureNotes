/* 
    Some fun fact vocab & good to know of things:
        - JS Statement: 
            - any block of code that is performing an action, i.e. the code directions we give the program, let x = 15;
            - JS programs are all just a bunch of statements.
        - JS Expressions: 
            - a block of code that evaluates to a value, i.e. performs some sort of action that *produces a value*
            - Expressions are statements, but statements are not all expressions
    
        To ask JS to perform logic (like conditionals, functions, etc.) we will commonly use this format:
            keyword name (expression) {
                ... code block of logic
            }
*/

/* 
    ? Conditionals
    - Our way to JS a question and get an answer as a response
    - Evaluates an expression and responds if it is true
    - Falsy
        - false
        - 0 
        - " ", ' ' (empty strings)
        - null
        - undefined
        - NaN (not a number)
*/

/* 
    If Statements: gives a yes/true response if the expression is true/valid

    Structure:
    if(expression evaluated) {
        ...code that runs only if expression is true
    }
