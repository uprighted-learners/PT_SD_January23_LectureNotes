# Getting Started

- create a `package.json`
  - In terminal: cli command: `npm init -y`
- Install our dependencies
  - express: `npm i express`
- Create a `.gitignore` file

  - `/node_modules` within .gitignore
    - tells our local repository to ignore the `node_modules` folder when backing up.

- node_modules folder

  - Provides us access to any "behind the scenes" code that helps run express and any dependencies.
  - If anything gets deleted or you're cloning down a project, use `npm install` to get those files back/installed.

- package-lock.json

  - locks project into required dependencies. Helps with our versioning
  - updated our `package.json` with `"main": "app.js"` instead of `index.js`.

- Create a root JS file

  - `app.js` or `index.js`

- Use the command `nodemon` to start the server
  - nodemon is a way for our server to continue to run while we are building/making changes.
    - To stop the server ctrl+c

### Controllers

Our controllers help us set routes for various endpoints. Depending on how we build the path will determine how it responds.

CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

- Create: POST
- Read: GET
- Update: PUT/ PATCH
- Delete: DELETE

We are going to set up a controller folder and make our first controller file called practice.controller.js.

Sending a status code with a route response is good practice for both the user and developer.
