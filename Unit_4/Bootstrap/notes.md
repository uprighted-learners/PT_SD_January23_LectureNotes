# The Game Plan

We want to build a recipe app that will grab a random recipe as well as let us save our favorite ones for later.

What we'll need:

- index.html: the gateway to the browser/DOM
- style.css: for custom/additional styling
- main.js: for our JS
- an API with recipes: [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api)

Bonus:

- A CSS Framework/Styling Library: [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

# To Do List

- [x] Create Base HTML, CSS, and JS files
- [x] Connect all three
- [x] Find BS components and add to html
- [ ] Sign up for and look at API
- [ ] Fetch random recipe
- [ ] Use JS to DOM manipulate create the BS cards

## Working With Bootstrap

- Created by Twitter
- A toolkit to help quickly build out a website
- Provides standard templates to various components such as:
  - Navbars
  - Progress Trackers
  - Forms, etc.
- Helps manage responsiveness for our page depending on what we use.
- Helps with keeping up with current design structures.

- A key way to quickly copy and paste components we need for sites/mock ups/etc.

### How we connect and use BS:

- Connect BS to project by following their "Getting Started" guide.
  - [Getting Started](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/)
  - Connect CSS with link tag and scripts with script tag
