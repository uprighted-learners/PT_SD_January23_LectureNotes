# Forms

- `<form>` groups input fields together
- `onsubmit` will gather data within the input fields and pass it on.
- Methods:
  - Types: (CRUD)
    - POST (Create)
    - GET (Read)
    - PUT (Update)
    - DELETE
  - Part of HTTP structure in how we pass data (Will learn about in unit 5 & 6)
- When a form is submitted, it automatically refreshes our browser.

## Some Attributes

- `for` helps tie labels with the input fields
- `autocomplete` allows us to show previous inputs that we might have had in past forms. Governs and depends on the browsers autocomplete feature.
- `type` notes what type of data to expect/we will receive
- `name` associates the name of the input (helps the label know what input it's attached to)
- `placeholder` is a way for us to write a note to users as to what might be input/written into the input field. Helper/guide text.
- `value` is what is held within the input when submitted
  - This gets populated when a user types into it/interacts with it.
