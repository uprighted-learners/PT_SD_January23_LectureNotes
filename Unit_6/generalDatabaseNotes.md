# Traditional Databases

Database:

- A collection of data stored in tables or documents.

- Sorts data by creating a **primary key (ID)** for each record (of data)
  - Records: data with/in rows of the table

### Two Main Types of Databases:

Relational:

    - Very similar to a table structure (like Excel or Google Sheets)
    - Have a strict structure
    - Tables can be linked using keys
    - Ex: SQL, PostgresSql, MySQL

Non-Relational:

    - Has 5 Types of Structure: document data store, column-oriented database, key-value store, document store, and graph database
    - Flexible Structure
    - Uses a Primary Key (ID) to give individuality to each document
    - Data is stored as documents containing JSON object
    - Ex: MongoDB, Apache Cassandra, Couchbase
