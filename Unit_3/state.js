/* 
?   Lookup Tables & State Machines

    * Lookup Table:
    - Objects that help us reference other values, great when working with collections of data.
    - Often called dictionaries, Objects work like dictionaries in JS, holding key value pairs to store collections of data.

    Lookup Table == Object/Dictionary
    
    These can help with/Why:
    - Make the code cleaner and easier to read
    - Eliminated branching of conditionals by creating a simpler lookup
    - Default evaluation does not need to wait for all conditions to get processed. If a key does not exist in the lookup table, it returns the default condition straightaway. 
    - Good for evaluating multiple rules/two or more conditions

// Create an arrow function named listGames with a parameter of system
const listGames = (system) => {
  // build a collection object
  let collection = {
    Nintendo: ["Duck Hunt", "The Legend of Zelda", "Super Mario Bros."],
    "Super Nintendo": ["Super Mario World", "F-Zero", "Star Fox"],
    Nintendo64: ["Super Mario 64", "Mario Kart 64", "GoldenEye 007"],
  };

  //console.log("Inside Function: ", collection["Nintendo64"]);

  return collection[system];
};

console.log(listGames("Nintendo64"));
console.log(listGames("Super Nintendo"));
console.log(listGames("Nintendo"));
console.log(listGames("Nope")); // Undefined if no match

// Another Example:

const stateAbbreviation = {
  alaska: "ak",
  delaware: "de",
  hawaii: "hi",
  indiana: "in",
  vermont: "vt",
};

const acronym = {
  asap: "as soon as possible",
  fomo: "fear of missing out",
  gif: "graphics interchange format",
  lol: "laugh out loud",
};

// console.log(stateAbbreviation[hawaii]);
// Create a findIt function that will use whatever object(dict) and key term(search) give and return the value result if found
function findIt(dict, search) {
  return dict[search];
}

let stateInUS = findIt(stateAbbreviation, "vermont");
console.log(stateInUS.toUpperCase());

let acro = findIt(acronym, "gif");
console.log(acro);

// An example with else ifs (conditionals) versus table lookup:
// We have to take of a kiddo based on how they feel

// function howIsChild with parameter name of state that returns messages based on the kids status
const howIsChild = (state) => {
  if (state == "Hungry") {
    return "THE KIDS WANTS FOOD, WHERE'S THE SNACKS!?!";
  } else if (state == "Sad") {
    return "The kiddo is crying, what do we do??";
  } else if (state == "Happy") {
    return "Aww, they're laughing!";
  } else {
    return "They're asleep.";
  }
};

console.log(howIsChild("Happy"));
console.log(howIsChild());

// Use a table and arrow function to do the above:
const kidFeelsTable = {
  Hungry: "THE KIDS WANTS FOOD, WHERE'S THE SNACKS!?!",
  Sad: "The kiddo is crying, what do we do??",
  Happy: "Aww, they're laughing!",
};

const howIsKiddo = (state) => kidFeelsTable[state] || "They're sleeping...";

console.log(howIsKiddo("Happy"));
console.log(howIsKiddo());

/* 
    * State Machines:
    - A state machine reads a set of inputs and changes to a different state based on those inputs.
    - A mathematical model of computation, usually used to design algorithms.

    State: is the set of all variables in a program and their values at any point in time.

    A simple example: A light switch.
    - The light switch has two states: on and off
    - Flipping the switch will transition to the other state
    - When the "machine" exits the on state, we get a side effect of the light turning off.
    - When the "machine" enters the on state, we get a side effect of the light turning on.
        https://statecharts.dev/on-off-state-machine.html

    A state machine is an alternative way of modeling program state: Instead of defining independent variables, a machine is crafted specifically to handle what states are possible, and when a machine is a given state, what next state is allowed.

// Build a traffic light state machine:
// create a state object with light color keys with values of an array to the other light color options

let state = {
  green: ["yellow"],
  yellow: ["red"],
  red: ["green", "yield"],
  yield: ["red"],
};

let currentState = "green";

// Create a function to handle and transition between states
function enterState(newState) {
  // Create a check to see what values are valid and available

  // Establish which point in our state object that we want to reference
  let validTransitions = state[currentState];

  console.log(`\nThe light is currently: ${currentState}`);

  // Check if our key includes the state the user wants to transition/change to
  if (validTransitions.includes(newState)) {
    // Allow our state to change if true to next state
    currentState = newState;
    return `The light turns ${currentState}`;
  } else {
    // Have a message if state is not available
    // console.log("Invalid state!");
    // use throw to stop, state, and define an error
    throw `Invalid state: ${currentState} to ${newState}`;
  }
