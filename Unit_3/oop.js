//* Object Oriented Programming
/* 
    - Encapsulated data and behavior through an exposed interface
        (we can access how we build and store data/dataType values)
    - Allows for inheritance of behavior(methods/functionality) via parent class that can share methods.
    - Abstraction of complexity (takes something complex and allows us to work with it)
    - Polymorphism of behavior (can act/do many things in it's many forms)
*/

//* Encapsulation
// Allows us to have a set of data within an object stored as a property.

class Pet {
  constructor(name, color) {
    this.name = name;
    this.coloration = color;
  }

  speak() {
    return `${this.name} says, "${this.voice}!"`;
  }
}

let buttons = new Pet("Buttons", "tri-color");
// console.log(buttons);
let tiny = new Pet("Tiny", "fawn brown");
// console.log(tiny);
// console.log(tiny.speak());
// console.log(buttons.speak());

//console.log(`${tiny.name} goes woof!`); // Not as flexible and clean code compared to the method

// ----------------------------------------------

//* Inheritance
// We can create child classes that can inherit from a parent class.

// Ex 1: Change up our Pet class and create a new child class called Dog that extends from it
/* 
    New Keywords: extends, super
    - extends denotes that our Dog class is a child of Pet class
    - super sets which properties we are inheriting from the parent class. We can also add additional properties unique to the child class (in this ex, voice).
*/
class Dog extends Pet {
  // constructor needs parameters for super and unique properties
  constructor(name, color, voice) {
    // super defines and passes values to properties from/inherited from parent
    super(name, color);
    this.voice = voice;
  }

  //   speak() {
  //     return `${this.name} says, "${this.voice}!"`;
  //   }
}

let daisy = new Dog("Daisy", "Tan and White", "Scream");
console.log(daisy);
console.log(daisy.speak());

// Ex 2: Create a child class of Cat from Pet class
class Cat extends Pet {
  constructor(name, color, voice) {
    super(name, color);
    this.voice = voice;
  }
}

let bowser = new Cat("Bowser", "Grey", "Meow");
console.log(bowser);
// console.log(bowser.speak()); // TypeError: bowser.speak is not a function
console.log(bowser.speak()); // Works after adding speak to parent class object

// --------------------------------------
//* Abstraction
// A way to store some of the complex logic that we may associate with our object methods
// Hiding the complexity of how things work via an objects methods

// Ex: Create a base class that has a method to help up calculate a tip amount with a given tab that has been created.
class Tab {
  constructor(sub, tax) {
    this.subtotal = sub;
    this.tax = tax;
    this.tip;
  }

  // Using a method to perform functionality, aka abstraction
  tipAmount(x) {
    // create a total of the subtotal and tax
    let total = this.subtotal + this.tax;

    // calculate tip and give value
    this.tip = total * x;
    // calculate the final total for the bill
    let finalAmount = total + this.tip;
    // return final amount
    return finalAmount.toFixed(2);
  }
}

// Set up some variable to hold some information: sales tax, a tip percentage, and a generated a new bill/Tab object
let salesTax = 0.06;
let tipPercent = 0.2;

let dinnerBill = new Tab(54.8, salesTax);
console.log(dinnerBill);

// Create a function that takes in a bill and processes it using the method held within the object itself
function calcTip(bill) {
  return bill.tipAmount(tipPercent);
}

// console.log and see the magic happen
console.log(`Final Cost: $${calcTip(dinnerBill)}`);
console.log(`With a tip of: $${dinnerBill.tip.toFixed(2)}`);

// ----------------------------------------------
//* Polymorphism
/* 
    - How objects respond in relationship from child to parent.
    - All children/siblings can use the methods of the parent.
    - Children/siblings can't access properties of other children/siblings (including methods)
*/
